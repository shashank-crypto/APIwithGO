# My first GOlang project

In this project I am going to create an API with noSQL mongoDB <br>

## General Questions

How to define schema properties in mongoDB in golang ? <br>

Like   
- required: true
- unique : true
- default : time.Now()


### issues: 

- Need to add the Id is not good


> Can I have the complete doc rather than just having the Id after I insert the doc ?

Why am I getting a response for the postId that is not even there in the post ?
